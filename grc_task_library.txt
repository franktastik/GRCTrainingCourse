# üõ°Ô∏è GRC Task Library for ERPNext-Based Home Lab (Training Track Edition)

This expanded track includes 40 tasks each at **Junior**, **Mid-level**, and **Senior** levels. It's designed to simulate real-world GRC roles across audit, policy, security, compliance, and governance functions using an AWS-hosted ERPNext application.
